<h1>null Privacy Policy</h1>
Welcome to null! We will refer to this as our "Service".<br>
This service is operated by LIT Devs ("us", "we") for users of the service ("you"). Usage of the Service is governed by our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.<br>
LIT Devs is not affiliated with <i>any</i> company, including but not limited to Discord Inc., Neatnik LLC (OMG.LOL), and Devsisters Corporation (Cookie Run).

<h2>Data we collect</h2>
We collect your Discord ID, username, and messages. This information is required for the Service to operate.<br>
Your Discord ID and username stay on our servers and are only used to identify you.<br>
Some recent messages that have been sent are stored on our servers to display previous conversations when null is opened, but they are cleared frequently.

<h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>
GingerBrave is my favorite cookie! Wait, we're not talking about Cookie Run? Oh. That makes sense.<br>
We use cookies to store a session ID on your computer, so we can identify you.<br>
We do not store any other cookies, and we do not embed tracking or analytics code in the Service.<br><br>
Please note that when you go to Discord or OMG.LOL, their Terms of Service and Privacy Policy apply, which may override this Privacy Policy.

<h2>OMG.LOL customers</h2>
For OMG.LOL customers, we offer null profile redirects. If they wish, their null profile will redirect to their OMG.LOL address.<br>
Usage of OMG.LOL is governed by their separate <a href="https://meta.omg.lol/info/terms">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://meta.omg.lol/info/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.<br>

<h2>Deleting your account</h2>
If you wish to delete your account, you may run the <code>/delete-account</code> command in the null chat window.<br>
We may still store your messages, as mentioned in "Data we collect".

<h2>Contact information</h2>
If you have any questions or need help, our email address is null (at) omg (dot) lol.<br>
